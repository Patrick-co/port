          <p>Take a closer look into who I am, where I come from, and how I began my journey to becoming a creative developer. Inside, I share things I’ve learned, recommended courses, and much more.</p>

          <p class="story-sub-title">Where I Started</p>
          <p>I grew up surrounded by color pencils, paper, and whatever I could grab to make something. I was always messing around, drawing, building little things, or just trying to figure out how stuff worked. I’ve always been curious — I can’t just watch something happen, I need to know why and how.</p>
          <p>For over ten years, I worked in hospitality. And honestly? I loved it. Meeting new people, hearing their stories, bouncing ideas around — that was my jam. I was constantly inspired by the creativity and energy of the people around me. But when COVID hit and the world shut down, everything paused. It gave me time to reflect and ask myself: What am I really doing? Where do I want to go next? That’s when I realized I wanted a new challenge — something I could build, control, and grow on my own terms. Coding started to look like the perfect fit.</p>
          <p>And honestly, a big part of me always knew I’d end up here. The curiosity, the love of figuring out how things work, the drive to create something from nothing — it was all pointing me toward building. Hospitality gave me patience, people skills, and an eye for detail, but I wanted to take that same energy and channel it into making things you can see, click, and interact with. It felt like the perfect bridge between creativity and problem-solving, and I was ready to dive in.</p>

          <p class="story-sub-title">My Journey Into Developement</p>
          <p>I’m a self-taught full stack developer, leaning more toward front-end web development, though I’m always open to expanding my skills. My journey has been a mix of online courses, hours of video tutorials, and hands-on experimentation. Programs like Deveslopes and other online learning platforms helped me strengthen my skills, while building my own projects pushed me to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios.</p>
          <p>For me, coding is the perfect blend of logic and creativity. I enjoy taking an idea from concept to execution, designing something that is not only functional but also visually engaging and user-friendly. Every small project reinforces my skills and teaches me something new about the process of building web experiences.</p>

          <p class="story-sub-title">Looking Forward</p>
          <p>I’m excited to continue learning, building, and sharing my work with others. My goal is to craft experiences that are not only functional but also creative, user-friendly, and memorable. Every project is a new opportunity to challenge myself, experiment with ideas, and grow as a developer.</p>
